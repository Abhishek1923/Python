# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
